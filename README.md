I made this in 2021 with the intent of making it a full chess engine.
Rather quickly, I realized that Batch was not at all powerful enough
to run the computations needed to calculate future moves. This is as
far as I got before I moved making this project into another language.

In it's current version, it only sees whether or not the king is
checked only if the piece checking the king is on a lower row, or if
its on the same row, it'll only detect the check if its to the right
of the king. I don't plan on returning to this project and fixing this.

Still a pretty fun demo though!
